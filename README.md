# hl

A rust rewrite of [highmon.pl] script for [weechat] irc client. With less feature.

This project is for learning the rust ffi primitives. Probably not portable.
Untested outside x64 linux machine. Don't use it. If you wanna write your
weechat plugin, use rust-weechat crate by poljar (see [resource](#resource)
section below). It's a lot better than this cute mess.

Currently this already works and used daily by me (6 days to be precise).

# Introduction

Should I write a guide on how to do ffi stuff in rust? I don't even
use cargo (sorry).  The ffi interface in plugin.rs is also
semi-automatic, it's orignally generated by bindgen but also heavily
edited.

The command to compile and install the project is in the Makefile. You
probably need specific version of weechat/weechat-plugin.h for it to works.

After executing `make`, it will produce a shared object `hl.so` that you can use
as weechat plugin by putting it in your weechat config directory. You can execute
`make install` if you use the default weechat config location.

**TL;DR**

* `make`
* `make install`

# Todo/Future Improvement

* Reduce the use of unsafe.
* Reduce the use of globals.
* Write test.
* Proc macro for declaring the plugin metadata
* Make it works for any version of weechat.
