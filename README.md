A rust rewrite of [highmon.pl script](https://github.com/KenjiE20/highmon) for [weechat irc client](https://weechat.org/). With less feature.

This project is for learning the rust ffi primitives. Probably not portable. Untested outside x64 linux machine. Don't use it. If you wanna write your weechat plugin, use rust-weechat crate by poljar, link in the resource section below. It's a lot better than this cute mess.

Currently this already works and used daily by me (1 day to be precise as of this writing).

# Introduction

Should I write a guide on how to do ffi stuff in rust? I don't even
use cargo (sorry).  The ffi interface in plugin.rs is also
semi-automatic, it's orignally generated by bindgen but also heavily
edited.

The command to compile and install the project is in the Makefile. You
probably need specific version of weechat/weechat-plugin.h for it to works.

# Todo/Future Improvement

* Reduce the unsafe.
* Reduce the use of globals.
* Write test.
* Easier C string literal that automatically converted to [i8; N]. A null-terminated array of c_char. Probably using proc-macro.
* Make it works for any version of weechat.
